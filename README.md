### Creative coding major project
Instructions on how to interact with the work: Clicking on the flower center with your mouse on the screen will cause the flower to bloom.Bubbles appear on the screen when the space bar is pressed, and empty the bubbles on the screen when "c" is pressed.

Details of individual methods for adding animated effects to group code.

I chose User Input to drive your personal code.

![An image of jellyfish](OIP.jfif)

Based on the jellyfish in the original design concept for the group section, I modified the group's code to make it closer to the ocean theme. First I changed the overall color scheme and background to make it more like a Marine environment. Then I added two translucent circles of different sizes to the flower part of the original image to make it look more like a jellyfish, and animated it to increase mouse interaction. When the mouse clicks on the center of the flower, it will bloom and make its movement look more like a jellyfish. To get closer to the ocean scene and add a layer of floating bubbles moving up, I'll add an array of bubbles to hold the individual bubble data and create functions to make it move. The bubbles will slowly drift upward, reaching the top and resetting to the bottom.And add interaction to the bubble section.
