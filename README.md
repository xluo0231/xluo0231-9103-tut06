### Creative coding major project
Instructions on how to interact with the work: Clicking on the flower center with your mouse on the screen will cause the flower to bloom.

Details of individual methods for adding animated effects to group code.

I chose User Input to drive your personal code.

![An image of jellyfish](OIP.jfif)
Based on the jellyfish in the original design concept for the group section, I modified the group's code to make it closer to the ocean theme. First I changed the overall color scheme and background to make it more like a Marine environment. Then I animate the flower part of the image to increase mouse interaction, and when the mouse clicks on the center of the flower, it will bloom, making its movement look more like a jellyfish.
